***March 2025***

Determined that Hankook tires outperformed Pirelli tires.

- Sourced and cleaned data from Lamborghini Super Trofeo Series from the Laguna Seca track for the 2021-2024 racing seasons
- Analyzed the switch in tire companies from Pirelli to Hankook in 2023 and the impact on both tire degradation and overall performance

## <span>&#9734;</span> Data Analytics and Visualizations

As the lead data analyst, I created all visuals regarding Race 1, Race 2, and the sectors of the circuit. Additionally, I produced the final models for the individual sector lap times and overall lap times that maintained low variance inflation factors and different significant predictors for each model.

The written report can be can be viewed [here](/Analyzing Tire Degradation.pdf).
