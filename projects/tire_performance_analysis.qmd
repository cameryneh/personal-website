**March 2025**

Determined that Hankook tires outperform Pirelli tires.


Sourced and cleaned data from Lamborghini Super Trofeo Series from the Laguna Seca track for the 2021-2024 seasons. 

- Analyzed the switch in tire companies from Pirelli to Hankook in the year 2023 and its impact on tire degradation and overall performance
- Was the lead data analyst and created the visuals for data regarding Race 1, Race 2, and the different sectors within the course
- Produced models for each sector lap times and the overall lap times with significant predictors and low variance inflation factors

The final written report can be can be seen [here](/Analyzing Tire Degradation.pdf).
