***July 2024***

Concluded that online gaming, when engaged with mindfully, can have beneficial effects on mental health.

- Developed and designed a website through WordPress to present the data analysis, visualizations, and overall insights
- The 2 datasets with 174,000+ rows combined contain various mental health metrics as well as geographical, socioeconomic, and behavioral information of online video game players from across the globe

## <span>&#9734;</span> Data Visualizations and Insights

Serving as the head data analyst and visualization specialist, I used Tableau to craft each chart, plot, and graph for this project. Additionally, I meticulously cleaned the data to ensure consistency across variables and assist in preparation for analysis.

The developed website, along with the visualizations and findings, can be viewed through this [link](https://cyber-psyche.humspace.ucla.edu/).
