***December 2024***

Achieved 99.456% predicting accuracy with random forest modeling.

- Cleaned 32,000+ observations of data and 29 predictors consisting of both numerical and categorical values
- Narrowed down significant predictors and input values of 'ntree' and 'mtry' to reach most accurate predictions

## <span>&#9734;</span> Data Cleaning and Modeling

We achieved higher accuracy in our model by imputing missing values based on the type of predictor: mean for numerical predictors and median for categorical predictors. Cross validation was used to condense predictors used with our random forest modeling.
