##### **Hello!** {style="text-align: center;"}
My name is Cameryn Harvey, and I am a current fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA. 
\
I enjoy creating stories with data through visualizations and interpretations. My experiences have involved solving real-world problems, which has enhanced my abilities of data cleaning, modeling and analyzing. 
\
I'm actively looking for full-time employment post-graduation to apply my skills in more hands-on and impactful ways!
